# Conclusions
st.header("Conclusions and Recommendations")
st.write("""
### Key Findings

#### The Impact of Weather on Bike Rentals

- **Clear Weather Conditions** yield the highest average rentals (4,877 bikes/day)
- **Light Rain/Snow** significantly decreases rentals (1,803 bikes/day, 63% lower than clear days)
- **Mist/Cloudy** shows reasonably good performance (4,036 bikes/day, only 17% lower than clear days)
- Data distribution is uneven: 463 clear days, 247 misty/cloudy days, and only 21 days with light rain/snow

#### Seasonal and Weather Variations

- **Fall Season** shows the highest rentals across all weather conditions
- **Summer** shows strong performance, particularly on clear days
- **Winter and Spring** generally have lower rental numbers
- Clear weather consistently outperforms other weather conditions in all seasons
- **Fall with Clear weather** combination shows the highest average rentals
- **Light Rain/Snow in spring** shows the lowest rental performance

#### Weekday vs Weekend Usage Patterns

- **Weekdays**: Two distinct peak periods at 8 AM and 5-6 PM (510 and 470 rentals)
- **Weekends**: A single broader peak spanning from around 11 AM to 5 PM (380 rentals)
- The maximum weekday peak is about 34% higher than the weekend peak
- Between 10 AM and 3 PM, weekend rentals substantially exceed weekday rentals
- Early morning (midnight to 6 AM) shows minimal activity on both day types

#### Behavior by User Type

- **Registered Users**:
  - Dominate overall rental volume, particularly on weekdays
  - Show two distinct commuting peaks on weekdays (morning 440 rentals, evening 460 rentals)
  - On weekends, follow a single-peak pattern (midday 240 rentals)
- **Casual Users**:
  - Show a single-peak pattern on both weekdays and weekends
  - Weekend usage significantly exceeds weekday usage
  - Peak rentals occur at 1-2 PM on weekends (140 rentals)
  - Display a leisure-oriented pattern regardless of the day type

#### Annual Growth

- Substantial increase in average rentals from 2011 to 2012 across all months
- Growth rate appears most significant in the earlier months (January-March)
- 2011 peaks in June (~4,800 rentals), while 2012 peaks in September (~7,250 rentals)
- The lowest rental periods occur in winter months (December-February)
- The average increase is approximately 2,000 additional rentals in 2012

#### Seasonal Patterns by User Type

- **Registered Users**:
  - Fall shows the highest average rentals (~4,400)
  - Spring has the lowest rentals (~2,300)
  - Winter and summer show similar performance (~4,000 rentals)
- **Casual Users**:
  - Fall and summer show the highest usage (~1,200 and ~1,100 respectively)
  - Spring has the lowest usage (~300)
  - Display greater seasonal sensitivity than registered users

#### Correlations with Weather Variables

- **Temperature**: Strong positive correlation (0.63) with total rentals
- **Windspeed**: Negative correlation (-0.23) with rentals, confirming riders are deterred by windy conditions
- **Humidity**: Slight negative correlation (-0.10) with rentals
- **Casual Users** are more strongly affected by temperature (0.54) than registered users
- **Registered Users** show stronger negative correlation with windspeed (-0.22)

#### Business Implications

1. **Differential Marketing Strategies**:
   - Commuter programs for registered users on weekdays
   - Recreational promotions for casual users, especially on weekends
   - Special strategies to boost rentals on light rain days

2. **Operational Planning**:
   - Bike availability should be optimized differently for weekdays versus weekends
   - Maintenance should be scheduled during low-demand periods (early morning hours)
   - Staffing can be adjusted based on weather forecasts

3. **Growth Opportunities**:
   - Spring represents the greatest opportunity for growth initiatives
   - The midday weekday period shows potential for growth through targeted promotions
   - Conversion strategies from casual to registered should focus on summer and fall

4. **Revenue Projections**:
   - Revenue projections can be significantly influenced by seasonal weather patterns
   - Registered users drive the majority of business (0.95 correlation with total rentals)
   - Weather forecasting could be integrated into business planning"
